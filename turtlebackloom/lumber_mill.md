# A Kid in the Candy Store.

I was hooked the minute we pulled up.  Something about a giant counter blanced crane made out of tree trunks and limbs and massive piles of rouch cut slab lumber... what can I say?

We drove up to the mountains a couple of days ago to visit the lumber man.  Alen mills wood in the Black Range around Kingston, New Mexico.  All the wood is standing dead from the forest and in that area it is mostly Aligator Juniper.

I've been scavenging lumber for the Turtleback Loom for the past couple of months but had never quite found the piece I want to use as the "spine" of the loom - the two rails into which everything else is fitted.  I heard about Alen from a friend and instantly knew that he would have what I needed so a day was schedueled and we went for a drive.  

Alen had stacks and stack of lumber all of which was amazing.  I found some pieces that would work but they were all so beautiful I could not bring myself of buy them only to be cut up.  Alen, though, had a solution: just mill one to the size I need.  So we manhandled a log up on the mill and he went to work. 

While Alen was cutting away I dug around and found some odds and ends which I'll use for other projects around the house.  When I got home and laid the wood out I had a grin from ear to ear. 

The pieces turned out fantastic and I set to work as soon as I got home.  I'm a neanderthal when it comes to wood working and do most of my work with hand tools.  I ripped the plank into three pieces, two of which will be the rails of the Turtleback Loom.  The rest of the plank I left whole as I need to figure out just what I want to do before I start cutting.  I've left the planks to dry for a week and settle into their final shape before I start to work them.
