  <h1>Turtleback Loom</h1>
  <p>It always begins with a pile of wood. In my case nasty, found wood.  Wood which is destined for a fireplace or worse yet the slash pile or the landfill.  Wood forgotten and half buried in the New Mexico earth - which as luck would have it rots nothing.</p>

  <p>These orphaned chunks of cellulose reveal magic when you look closer.  Out of old abused pallets comes 3x4 inch chunks of oak and 1x4 inch planks of the most delightful poplar.  The old nail holes, rust stains and general abuse lends a great patina to the finished product.  It's character as they say when you get older and I'm all about it.</p> 

  <p>This aforementioned pile of wood is going to become a loom.  People have been building looms out of simple materials for thousands of years so I see no reason why we can't do the same.  The design of the loom is a simple counterbalance frame loom.  Iâ€™m going to add features from two types of looms I really enjoy: those found in Japan and those found in northern New Mexico.</p> 

  <p>The Japanese influence can be readily seen in the wood work - I'll be using japanese style joinery for all the piecies.  In fact there will be no nails or screws on the loom - everything will be easily disassembled; held together by well cut joints and matching wedges.  I'm going to adopt a japanese style castle for the loom as well, this will allow for more flexiablity in placement of the beater and harnesses as well as the easy addition of a flying shuttle.</p> 

  <p>The northern New Mexico influence is the "walking" loom aspect.  This loom will be taller than normal and is meant to be stood at while working instead of sat at.  I like the idea of standing when weaving and I think it fits especially with tapestry weaving which is what we will mostly be doing on this loom.</p>  

  <p>I'm going to call this loom design the "turtleback loom".   It will be the first of many, many looms I build and will be a fascinating learning project I'm sure.</p>

  </p>The initial plans are available online <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=91d33c8a302617b5f306662694cb45e1">here</a>.  These plans will evolve as I build the loom which I will update here. </p>
