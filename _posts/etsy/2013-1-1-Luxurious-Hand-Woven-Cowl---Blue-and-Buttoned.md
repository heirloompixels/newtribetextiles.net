Luxurious Hand Woven Cowl - Blue and Buttoned

This wrap cowl/scarf is for all occasions...work, play and everything in between.

Hand woven in variations of the traditional rose path pattern, and hand dyed by me, this cowl has an amazing visual texture.  The warp is yellow and the weft is a deep, rich blue. (with some yellow accent stripes)  It is 100% Merino wool, which is ultra soft and has no itch.

it wraps around with a large wooden button closure.  The button hole was formed with intricate macrame on the fringe. 
 
The cowl is 8 1/5 inches wide by 42 inches long. (see the last photo)
