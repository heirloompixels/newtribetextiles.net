Winter Warm - Indian Hand-loom Wool Lined With Hand Dyed Raw Silk - Full Moon Appliqué

Winter warmth.
This skirt is ready for winter!  Are you?
The body of the skirt is made from handwoven wool that I brought back from Kinnaur Valley in India, and is lined with hand dyed (by me) raw silk.   The waist-band and ties are Ikat cotton form india and the pocket was made with raw silk.    The full moon appliqué was also made with raw silk. 

It is 29inches long and will fit up to a 46inch waist measurement.  When you are ordering please be sure that that it is the proper size for you.   

Thanks for checking out my work!
Made with love!
