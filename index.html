  Welcome to the home of one of a kind luxury handmade natural fiber textiles and handmade treasures for lovers of life!   The creations that you will find here have been brought to life through the processes of dyeing, spinning, weaving, sewing, beading and knotting to achieve the perfect color palates, textures, patterns and drapes.   The skills used in creating these pieces come from a lifelong passion for creation and experimentation, and I feel like I have only just begun!   Although I have experimented with many mediums from glass blowing, ceramics and sewing to photography, woodworking and paper making, it wasn't until our two years in India when a deep love for textiles sprang forward.   Upon returning to the States we bought a loom off of craigslist, and have not stopped weaving since.

      Textiles borne into the world by human hands, meant for the touch of human skin.  Creating textiles is a direct path for me to connect with who we are as humans; not just to cloth ourselves from the elements, but to adorn ourselves with somethings beautiful and sensually appealing.   All the fibers I use are either their naturally occurring color, or hand dyed by me with natural wild harvested dyes, or professional dyes.

    From handwoven raw silk cuffs to sculptural fiber necklaces, there is something to catch every eye.  Incorporating found objects such as crystal, stone, shell, bone, wood and feathers into meticulously constructed wearable works of art is very important to me.   The positive energy that I put into each one of the pieces and the intrinsic energy in the simple treasures included in each work creates a special object that someone can treasure for their whole life.

   Wear handmade! Clothing made with love and care, not just for special occasions but for everyday work and play.  Many of the pieces I create incorporate sumptuous handwoven fabrics to create a look that is truly unique.
